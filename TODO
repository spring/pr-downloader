=rapid=
 * use /packages/selected.list for pinned tags / downloaded files
 * dont download directly to pool or packages dir but to a temp dir
 * use c++ streams http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3023988/can-one-read-a-remote-file-as-an-istream-with-libcurl ?
 * (clean?) duplicate search results (with same md5)
 * delete old games?
 * check for errors

=widget=
 * remove it or finish it? it does't fit to the other downloaders (widgets are not needed to play the game...)
 * backup for old widgets (before getting overwritten)
